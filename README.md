Welcome to our game: "Draining"

In this game, you play as a blood hero who fights against a variety of monsters for survival. But the twist is, everytime you attack, you lose health. The battle takes place in an arena where blood fills to the floor. The blood on the floor helps you regenerate. You must conserve your health and use your attacks wisely. You also get coins which you can use in the shop to get powerups and boosters. You sacrifice a portion of your health to clear the enemies. This game continues indefinitely. Have fun.
